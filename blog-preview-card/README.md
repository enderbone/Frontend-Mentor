## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I have learned a lot abbout how to centralize objects and make a responsive website. Furthermore, i felt free to try out some css codes that i learned in my free time, like the one below.

```html
<button class="category">Learning</button>
```
```css
.category {
    background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);

    border-radius: 3px;
    padding: 0.5em 1em;
    border-width: 0px;

    font-weight: 800;
    margin: auto;
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
    margin-top: 1em;
    font-size: 0.8em;

    transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.category:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);
}
```

### Continued development

I had a lot of difficulty adjusting the author's name to his image so that it was centered. I believe this is something I want to focus on in future projects, as it took a long time and gave me a lot of headaches.
