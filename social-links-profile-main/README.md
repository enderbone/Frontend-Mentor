## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Learned a little bit of how to use flexbox to centralize divs on my site. This save me a lot of time and make my work much easier. Additionally, I also learned how to better work on responsiveness using the "vh" unit.

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

Want to focus on my flexbox learning. This proved to be a powerful resource and i think it is a great ally on my futures css codes.

### Useful resources
